# A2Z Insurance
This is a Data Mining group project made with the aim of segmenting customers from an insurance company using a provided dataset to understand their value and demographics, and help the company develop targeted marketing strategies. For its development, we were provided with a database from an insurance company, A2Z, that contains information about their customers and the type of premiums they bought in 2016. Our main goal is to segment customers, finding relevant clusters, and helping the company understanding the value and demographics of each customer segment. With that information, it is possible to understand which types of insurance each cluster will be more interested in buying, as well as develop targeted marketing strategies.

## General Context

In every industry, it is important to find new customers, and this starts by gaining knowledge from existing customers. Understanding current customers helps organizations identify different groups of customers with varying product interests, market participation, and response to marketing efforts. Through market segmentation, which identifies customer groups based on geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral traits, organizations can make better strategic decisions about opportunities, product definition, positioning, promotions, pricing, and target marketing.

## Business Situation

A2Z Insurance is a Portuguese insurance company that offers a variety of insurance services, with a significant portion of their customer acquisition coming from their website. However, due to the lack of a data-driven culture, the company has poorly maintained databases, resulting in mass-marketing and missed cross-selling opportunities. A2Z wants to start segmenting its customers and developing focused programs by using an Analytic Based Table (ABT) with data on a sample of 10,290 customers from its active database, to understand the value, demographics, and insurance preferences of each customer segment.
